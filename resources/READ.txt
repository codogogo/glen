The following resources are not part of the GitHub repo due to file sizes, but need to be obtained in order to successfully run GLEN:

(1) the lexical constraints we used as training examples to learn the explicit specialization function for LE (needed if you're running the training script)
(2) the serialized distributional space (fasttext, EN) which you can specialize (needed if you're running either the training or prediction script)
(3) the pre-trained GLEN specialization model (needed if you're running the prediction script)

These resources are available at: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d6re6aOuoTWvJ8M821G1bh3rNPLHv2yd/view?usp=sharing

Download and unzip the archive and you will find three directories: 

(1) constraints
(2) distributional
(3) model

Copy these three directories into the this directory ("resources") in which you found this READ file.
